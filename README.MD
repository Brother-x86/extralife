Hey,

Its a small program in rust to help you having an 'extra life' ‚ù§Ô∏è in case of your beacon/implant crash.
Extra life will monitor a process, and every time this process crash, extra life will respawn the process.

- Without arguments extralife will monitor and re-spawn it's parent process.
- But you can also specify a pid as argument to monitor an other process, example: `extralife.exe 4994`

# example with Sliver C2

Add an extra life to your running Sliver.

As you see the process tree, you got one extra life

Demonstration, extra life give you an other session if you die:

You are the child of extralife.exe now as you see in the process tree:

If you want to die/crash the beacon, you can remove extra life, your beacon program will continue to run but not forever:

## compilation

I test it only for windows, you can compile it like that:

```
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

## pro tips

if you execute extralife.exe twice, you will have you 2 extra life !! üíï

## improvement todo :
- remember the commandline of the target process to recreate exact same process.
- and reuse the working dir of the target process, just in case.

Hey,

Its a small program in rust to help you having an 'extra life' ‚ù§Ô∏è in case of your beacon/implant crash.

Without arguments extralife will re-spawn it's parent process, but you can also specify a pid as argument to monitor an other process : `extralife.exe 4994`

# example with Sliver C2

Add an extra life to your running Sliver.

As you see the process tree, you got one extra life

Demonstration, extra life give you an other exec if you die:

The process tree is like that now: (you are the child of extralife.exe)

If you want to die, you can remove extra life, your beacon program will continue to run:

## pro tips

if you execute extralife.exe twice, you will got 2 extra life !! üíï

## improvement todo :
- remember the commandline of the target process to recreate exact same process.
- and reuse the working dir of the target process, just in case.
